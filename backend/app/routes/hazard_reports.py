    """A citizen reporting a hazard they're seeing, or flagging that they
    need help — matches the mobile app's "Reports" tab (`category`,
    `description`, `location_name`; `category` is freeform rather than a
    server-enforced enum since the mobile UI's category list — see
    `mobile-app/lib/data/hazard_report.dart`'s `hazardCategories` — is a
    suggestion, not the only valid set, and other channels (USSD, web)
    may want to send their own).

    `needs_assistance` distinguishes "I need help now" from a routine
    condition report ("water is rising on my street") — both are the
    same shape, just with different urgency, rather than two separate
    endpoints.

    `latitude`/`longitude` are optional — real when the caller has a GPS
    fix (the mobile app's onboarding and Reports screen both wire this up
    via `geolocator`), `null` otherwise. No reverse geocoding happens
    here or on the mobile side.

    No routing to a responder or dispatch of any kind happens here yet —
    this only persists the report to `app/data/hazard_reports.json` so it
    can be listed (`GET /api/hazard-reports`) and eventually shown on the
    admin dashboard. Deciding what happens with a `needs_assistance`
    report (who sees it, how fast) is a separate, not-yet-built piece.

    `POST /api/hazard-reports/{id}/photo` — this endpoint never accepts
