"""Inference for the ML "second opinion" flood risk model.

Loads the pipeline trained by train_ml_model.py (a StandardScaler +
LogisticRegression pipeline, saved to ml_risk_model.pkl) once at import
time, so the server doesn't retrain on every request or every restart.

This runs ALONGSIDE risk_model.py's rules-based compute_risk(), not
instead of it — see docs/architecture.md for why the team kept both.
The rules-based score stays the primary, explainable one; this is a
comparison/second opinion, trained on synthetic data (see
train_ml_model.py's docstring for what a real-data upgrade would need).
