"""Validates the existing risk model (both the rules-based formula and
the trained ML model) against real historical flood data — built
2026-08-29, using `real_training_data_dfo.csv` (see
`fetch_real_training_data_dfo.py`).

**Why this is validation, not retraining.** The production model takes
`river_level_m` (meters). The only real historical river data available
here is GloFAS river *discharge* in m³/s (via Open-Meteo) — a genuinely
different physical quantity, not directly convertible to meters without
a river-specific rating curve this project doesn't have (see
`fetch_real_training_data.py`'s module docstring, which hit the exact
same wall). Faking that conversion to force real data into the
production model would be worse than not using it. So instead of
retraining, this script asks a narrower, still-genuinely-useful
question: **for each city, using that city's own relative discharge
level (a percentile within its own 1985–2010 range, not an absolute
meters value) as a stand-in for "how high is the river right now,"
would the existing model have flagged real DFO-confirmed flood days as
elevated risk?**

This is a real evaluation against 561 real, independently-sourced
(non-leaked) flood-days across all 10 cities — not a synthetic sanity
check — but it is an approximation (relative discharge percentile
standing in for river_level_m), not a claim that the production model
was tested against real river-level readings. State it exactly that way
if this gets cited anywhere.

Run it (needs `real_training_data_dfo.csv` to already exist — run
`fetch_real_training_data_dfo.py` first):
